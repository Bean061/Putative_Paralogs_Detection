# Putative Paralogs Detection (PPD)

This method is based on shared heterozygous information to detect putative paralogs for Hyb-Seq data. Highly recommended for Hyb-Seq downstream analysis.

## Prerequisites:
Run the main [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper) script and check the results in [individual]/[gene]/[individual]/sequences/intron/ and [individual]/[gene]/[individual]/sequences/FNA/ directories.

All the intron and exon sequences are considered as input for Step1.

It includes three steps as follows:



1. Concatenate all the supercontigs into a single file. Given a directory gerated by HybPiper called prefix:
